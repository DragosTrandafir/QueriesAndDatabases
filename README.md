# QueriesAndDatabases
Creating an sql Dedeman database and applying some SQL specific operations.
To run the sql files, open it in MySQL and run everything from top to bottom. I recommend to run first the creation of the database and the tables, all together. Then run the rest by turn, in order to see the results.
The requirements for each sql file is located in every separate directory.

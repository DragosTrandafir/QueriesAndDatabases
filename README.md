# QueriesAndDatabases
Creating an sql Dedeman database and applying some Queries operations.
To run the sql file, open it in MySQL and run everything from top to bottom. I recommend to run first the creation of the database and the tables, all together. Then run the rest by turn, in order to see the results.
